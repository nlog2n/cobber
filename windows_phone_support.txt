
Windows Phone support 

Is there any way to tell Confuser to target Windows Phone? By default, assemblies generated for Windows Phone, after being Confuser-ed, depend on libraries targeting a profile different from the one the phone runs, so the app crashes.


Silverlight support

due to the platform limitation of Silverlight, most of the critical protections of Confuser could not work properly. So Silverlight would not be officially supported in near future.
But as a workaround, you can try excluding Silverlight classes from Renaming, and use only Constructor Proxy, Method Proxy and Control Flow obfuscation. It should work at the moment.
