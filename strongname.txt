How to use StrongNameKeyPair with a password protected keyfile (pfx)?

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7556846/how-to-use-strongnamekeypair-with-a-password-protected-keyfile-pfx




I am trying to programatically sign an assembly using a password protected keyfile (pfx). However when I try to use the StrongNameKeyPair I get the following exception.

Unable to obtain public key for StrongNameKeyPair. at System.Reflection.StrongNameKeyPair.ComputePublicKey() at System.Reflection.StrongNameKeyPair.get_PublicKey()


Answer:

StrongNameKeyPair supports the snk file format directly in a constructor.

StrongNameKeyPair also has a constructor with a byte[] input. I Believe it's enough to build it from a PFX (see my answer).


Here is a piece of C# code that creates a StrongNameKeyPair object from a password-protected .PFX file:

  public static StrongNameKeyPair GetStrongNameKeyPairFromPfx(string pfxFile, string password)
    {
        X509Certificate2Collection certs = new X509Certificate2Collection();
        certs.Import(pfxFile, password, X509KeyStorageFlags.Exportable);
        if (certs.Count == 0)
            throw new ArgumentException(null, "pfxFile");

        RSACryptoServiceProvider provider = certs[0].PrivateKey as RSACryptoServiceProvider;
        if (provider == null) // not a good pfx file
            throw new ArgumentException(null, "pfxFile");

        return new StrongNameKeyPair(provider.ExportCspBlob(false));
    }

Comments:
Although the X509Certificate2Collection is innecessary (just use X509Certificate2) this is the best solution i've found.

Password Protected Stron-Name Key Support 
I just added a quick support of pfx in changeset 76548.
在Cobber.cs初始化的时候Initialize()读入。

Had to look at the source code for working this out, but hope this helps someone else trying to use PFX with Confuser (Options -> Strong name key):

    To use as password protected PFX via the Confuser UI, you first select the PFX file using the "..." button for "Strong name key".
    Then go to the end of the textbox (now showing the file path of the PFX you just selected) and add a "|" separator before typing in your password to the PFX
    Now you should be all ready to go... :D

If you don't specify the password to your PFX in this way, at the moment Confuser will not prompt you with a very useful message (or even ask you to enter your password). Instead, it crashes with this message:

Oops... Confuser crashed...

System.ArgumentException
Message : Unable to obtain public key for StrongNameKeyPair.
